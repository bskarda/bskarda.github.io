Any new climbing leader should learn some amount of self rescue and carry the necessary
tools. Here are some of my notes from the self rescue course that I taught with Virginia Tech's Rock Climbing Club.
I'll be cleaning them up and fleshing them out.

##Scenarios
- Dropped belay device
  - belay leader with remaining belay device
  - belay follower with munter hitch
- Leader unconscious
  - Are they more than half a rope length up?
  - Lower them down if possible
  - escape belay
- Follower unconscious
  - Counter Balance carry
- Rope jammed after pulling on rappel
  - Flick your rope next time
  - Can you lead up to it?
  - Prussic up and hope for the best
  - build anchor at bottom of climb w/ upward pull
  - attach rope to anchor
  - lead up stuck line w/ prussic or grigri placing gear
- Follower can't finish climb 
  - 3 to 1 raise
  - drop fixed line
  - drop loop (crevasse rescue)
- cut in rope while TRing
- Following route and pendulum into space

##Self rescue topics

never have someone hanging off 1 prussik
